Here is a suggested `Layered pattern architecture` 

#### Frontend:

- **Presentation layer:** This layer includes the user interface (UI) of the patient dashboard, which is responsible for displaying information to the user and allowing them to interact with the dashboard. It can be implemented using HTML, CSS, and Typescript.

- **Logic layer:** This layer includes the business logic and rules for the patient dashboard. It handles tasks such as fetching data from the backend, performing calculations, and updating the UI based on user input. It can also be implemented using Typescript.

#### Backend:

- **Data access layer:** This layer is responsible for interacting with the data store (e.g., a database) to retrieve and persist data for the patient dashboard. It can be implemented using Typescript and a library for accessing the data store (e.g., MongoDB).

- **Business logic layer:** This layer includes the business logic and rules for the patient dashboard. It handles tasks such as data validation, calculation of metrics, and enforcing business rules. It can also be implemented using Typescript.

- **Integration layer:** This layer is responsible for integrating the backend with external systems, such as the Ethereum network. It can be implemented using Typescript and a library for interacting with the Ethereum network (e.g., Web3).

#### Deployment:

**AWS:** The patient dashboard can be deployed on AWS using a variety of services, such as Amazon EC2 for hosting the backend and Amazon S3 for hosting the frontend.

**Ethereum network:** The backend can be integrated with the Ethereum network using the integration layer, allowing it to read and write data to the blockchain.
